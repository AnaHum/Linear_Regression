# Linear_Regression
The goal of this project is to build and train a regression model on the Capital Bike Share (Washington, D.C.) Kaggle data set, in order to predict demand for bicycle rentals at any given hour, based on time and weather.
In the project, I conduct an exploratory data analysis, apply the Linear regression model to the dataset as well as the Random Forest model and calculate RMSLE for the training and test set. In addition, I use various regularization methods to avoid overfitting and eventually compare them to determine the best result.
